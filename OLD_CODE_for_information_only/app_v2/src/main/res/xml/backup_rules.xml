    Backup Rules for FastMediaSorter
    
    Security Note:
    - network_credentials.db is excluded because it contains encrypted credentials
      that are tied to Android Keystore (hardware-backed). The encryption key 
      cannot be restored to a different device, making the backup useless.
    - datastore/* is excluded because it may contain device-specific settings
      and encrypted default password (also tied to Android Keystore).
      
    For future implementation: Consider password-based encryption (PBE) with
    master password if cloud backup of credentials is desired.
