# Privacy Policy for FastMediaSorter

**Last updated: November 30, 2025**

## Overview
FastMediaSorter is a media manager and slideshow application for local, network, and cloud storage. We are committed to protecting your privacy and operating transparently.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What Data We Access
FastMediaSorter accesses the following data **only on your device and configured storage**:

1. **Local Storage**
   - Photos, videos, audio files on device and SD cards
   - Used only for displaying, sorting, and organizing media

2. **Network Storage (Optional - User Configured)**
   - SMB/CIFS, SFTP, FTP server credentials you provide
   - File metadata from network shares
   - Direct connections from your device to your servers

3. **Cloud Storage (Optional - Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)**
   - File metadata: names, sizes, thumbnails, modification dates
   - Account email (for authentication display)
   - Limited to folders you explicitly select
   - OAuth tokens for authenticated access

### What We Store Locally
All data stored in app's private, encrypted storage:

- **Connection settings**: server addresses, paths, credentials (encrypted)
- **User preferences**: language, sort order, playback settings
- **Thumbnail cache**: temporary images for faster loading
- **Database**: resource configurations, file metadata cache

### What We DO NOT Collect or Share
- ❌ No analytics or usage tracking
- ❌ No advertising data
- ❌ No behavioral tracking
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No personal information (names, emails, phone numbers)
- ❌ **No servers**: Your data never goes to our servers (we don't have any)
- ❌ No third-party data sharing

## Logging and Debug Files
- In DEBUG builds the app may optionally write diagnostic logs to a file in the app-specific external storage directory to help troubleshooting when ADB is not available.  
	- Location (example): `/Android/data/com.sza.fastmediasorter.debug/files/logs/` on the device storage.  
	- These log files may include timestamps, log levels, component tags, and messages produced by the app and may include non-sensitive metadata such as file names and server addresses used by the app during operation.  
	- Logs do NOT contain stored passwords in plaintext (sensitive credentials are handled using secure storage).  
	- File logging is only enabled in debug builds and can be disabled by using the release build or by changing debug settings.  

## Cloud Storage Integration (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox)
